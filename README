Port of Clan Arena 1.13 by Mungo into Quake Enhanced

Supports horde and "test" maps in QE- see server.cfg for map names.

Original files and sources can be found on planetquake mirrors, e.g.
https://www.quaddicted.com/files/mirrors/ftp.planetquake.com/servers/arena

Server and source files: casrv13.zip
Client files (including maps and 3/2/1/Fight/Flawless sounds): farena12.zip

QE-specific notes:
- There is an issue changing levels if menus are enabled (server kicks all clients), don't use menus
- Unfortunately because of lack of menus, no console support (yet?) for Clan Arena mode

Remote server administration:
- Client: connect with `cl_filterstuffcmd 0` to get aliases registered
- You probably want to set `scr_maxlines 20` to see the output of various command aliases
- Hard-coded admin code is 9194, change in var.qc and recompile (in the future this will be a variable)
- Edit vars.qc to change map list/rotation for warp command

Server tips:
- Recommend setting `samelevel 1` in console and manually switching maps for now
- The server will default to running in 1v1 Rocket Arena mode, no config required
- If you want to run in Clan Arena (competition mode), setting `temp1 4` in
  server console before starting a map to enable pickup mode, or else use `admin` and `modeset`
- Use "plup" and "pldown" to change number of players per team (default is 4)
- To get horde maps working (highly recommended):
  + Copy ...\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake\rerelease\mg1\pak0.pak to %userprofile%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake\mg1
  + Save QEClanArena's pak1.pak  to %userprofile%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake\mg1
  + Start quake and do `game mg1` in console (use `path` to check which paks are active)
  + Start a match with game as Dimension of the Machine on one of the mgdmX maps
  + Use `admin` (9194) and `warp` commands (or `changelevel`) to switch to a hordeX level

                     Clan Arena mod v1.3 for Net Quake
                     ---------------------------------

        - "crush" bug fixed
        - All varaibles but "teams" and "rounds" can be set between rounds
          instead of between entire series
        - Server admins can set up their server to be a "pickup" server
          see the sections called "Pickup Server" and "Server Flags"


*****
Menus
*****

Menus are a new way for people to quickly and easily set up team games with
clan arena.  When the server is in competition or round-robin modes, each
player is given a menu listing the teams that they can join.  When they
select a team from the menu, their colors are automatically set and they
become a member of the team.  While waiting for the match to begin, they're
given a second menu which lets them pick a shirt color or uncommit.
Also, if everyone but one person is "ready", the name of the person who's
holding things up is given to everone.

To choose an option from the menu, either hit the number key corresponding
to the option number, or type the number in at the console.

Menus are enabled by the server admin with the server flags.


*****************
The setup command
*****************

The setup command is a quick and easy way to set up a match between teams.
When you type the "setup" command, the first thing that happens is a voting
starts to give you admin privileges.  Alternatively, you can become admin on
your own with the "admin" command.  Once you are admin, you are taken through
a series of menus that will configure the game.
As an example we will assume that you want to set up a 4on4 on dm3.  On the
first menu, when it asks how many teams, you would hit 2.  The second menu
asks how many players per team, you would enter 4 here.  The third menu
asks how many rounds to play.  For the example, you would hit 4 to choose
best of 9 rounds.  The next menu asks if you want "fullteams" enabled or not.
For more information about what "fullteams" does, see the commands section.
For the example you would hit 1 for yes.  Finally, on the last menu, you
choose option 2, for "dm3".  Once you are taken to dm3, the setup is complete.
All you have to do now is have each person join a team, and once everyone
has committed to a team, the match will start.


*************
Pickup Server
*************

When the "pickup" server flag is on, the server will run in "pickup" mode.
In "pickup" mode, the the mod behaves differently in the following ways:

        - The mod is always in "competition" mode

        - The "modeset" and "lock" commands are disabled

        - There's no server timeout

        - The "autolock" server flag still works, since it's the
          server admin's decision whether or not the server be locked


************
Server Flags
************

The server flags are set in the "temp1" console variable, as a bitmask.
The values of the bits and the flags are given here:
Bit    Value    Meaning         Description
-------------------------------------------
 0       1      Sounds          If set, Street Fighter sounds are used instead
                                of the MK sounds
 1       2      Autolock        If set, auotlock is enabled
 2       4      Pickup          If set, the server runs in "pickup" mode
 3       8      Menus           If set, menus are enabled
 4      16      Fullteams       If set, fullteams is on by default

To get the value for "temp1", add the value of the flags you want together.
For example, if you want to run a pickup server with menus off, and fullteams
on, the value for "temp1" would be 20 (4+16).  If you wanted to run a server
with Street Figher sounds, menus, and in pickup mode, the value for "temp1"
would be 13 (1+4+8).
The RECOMMENDED value for "temp1" is 12 (pickup on, menus on).

sounds
~~~~~~

The clan arena mod may be configured to use two sets of sounds. If you prefer
the Street Fighter sounds, set the server variable "sounds" to 0. If you
prefer the Mortal Kombat sounds, set "sounds" to 1. The Mortal Kombat sounds
are used by default.

autolock
~~~~~~~~

If "autolock" is set to 1, then the server automatically locks iself before
each series begins, and unlocks after each series.  If set to 0, autolocking
is disabled.

menus
~~~~~

If set to 0, this will disable the menus.  If 1, this will enable menus.
See the section called "menus" for a description.

pickup
~~~~~~

If set to 0, the server behaves as normal.  If set to 1, the server will
run in "pickup" mode.
See the section called "pickup server" for a description.

fullteams
~~~~~~~~~

If set to 0, "fullteams" is by default off.  If 1, it's on by default.
"fullteams" can still be changed by an admin.


************
Server Setup
************

To set up a Clan Arena server,
1. Extract the files in the caserver.zip into a 'quake\carena' directory.

2. Copy the pak0.pak from your Final Arena (quake\arena) directory
into your Clan Arena directory (quake\carena).
The Final Arena client pak is required to run a Clan Arena server (it includes
maps and sounds). It is available from: http://www.planetquake.com/servers/arena

3. Set the admin code using the 'caadmin.exe' utility (this is a win32 executable, for
unix machines, you will need to run this on a 95/NT machine, and copy the progs.dat).

4. Read the section called "Server Flags" and decide what options you want

5. Start the server with a command line like:
'winquake -dedicated 16 -game carena +temp1 12 +deathmatch 1 +map dm3'

NOTE: Clients must connect with a '-game arena' parameter.

Features
********

Modes
~~~~~

There are three different modes for clan arena:

- Normal Mode

Normal mode is where there are no teams and there is just one line of people.
People fight, and the winner fights the next player in line. When you lose a
fight, you go to the end of the line.  "players" controls how many people are
put into the arena at once.  If "players" is set to 3, 3 people would play
a 1on1on1.  If set to 4, it would be a 4 way.

- Competition Mode

A certain number of players are chosen from each team, determined by the
"players" setting, and placed into the arena.  When someone dies, someone
from his team replaces him (if there is someone left to replace him), and
everyone in the arena keeps their armor/health.  Once all but one team has
been eliminated, the round ends.  By default, a best of 9 rounds is played.
("rounds" setting controls the number of rounds played).  A different player
from each team starts the next round.  Once the series of rounds ends, the
team with the most wins in given the victory.

- Round Robin Mode

Only one player from each team is put into the arena.  As soon as the fight
ends the winner is teleported out to make room for the next set of players.
The series ends when everyone on a team has had a chance to play against
everyone else.  Keep in mind that this can create a large number of matches.
For example, a 2-team 4on4 would need to play 16 matches.  A 3-team 4on4on4
would be 64 matches long.  This mode should probably only be used for clans
interested in holding "official" matches, with 4 players to a team.
NOTE:  This mode forces "players" to 1, and "rounds" is set automatically

Number of Players
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Clan Arena, the number of players to be put into the arena is fully
configurable.  For example, if "players" is set to "3" on normal arena,
3 people would be put into the arena, making for a 1on1on1, with the last
one standing the winner.
In competition mode, if "players" is set to "2", two players from every
team are put into the arena at once.  For example, if there are 2 teams,
4 people would be put into the arena, making for a 2on2.

Number of Teams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The number of teams participating at once can be anywhere between 2 and 4.
This controls the MAXIMUM number of teams allowed.  The minimum to start
a game is always 2.

Arena on Any Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clan Arena doesnt require an arena map to be played.  Clan Arena works
on id maps.  In fact, it can also work on any map, as long as the map
name is specified in the server's localinfo as an "id-style" map.
Check the sample server.cfg for an example of how to do this.

Spectators on id Maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All non-players are non-solid spectators who can not be seen or heard. All
spectators have a null team value and are color 0 (white). A non-solid
spectator cannot move through a solid, including other players.
While you are a spectator, you can either walk around on your own,
or use the tracking camera. To use the tracking camera, press the attack
button, and then use the jump button to track the various players. If you
want to exit the track cam mode, press the attack button again.

********
Commands
********

settings
~~~~~~~~

This command is like modstatus in qwring, it shows the current settings of
the clan arena mod. Each setting can be changed by an admin using the
admin commands

atype           - armor type. 1 = red armor, 2 = yellow armor,
                              3 = green armor, 4 = no armor

armor		- how much armor you start with.
health		- how much health you start with.

(NOTE: an ammo value of 999 specifies unlimited ammo of that type of ammo.)

shells		- number of shells you start with. 
nails		- number of nails you start with.
rockets		- number of rockets you start with.
cells		- number of cells you start with.

teamplay        - standard teamplay variable.
players		- number of players from each team to fight at the same time.

                mode and defaults to 2, the other is for Competition mode and
                defaults to 4.
teams           - maximum number of teams.

mode            - current mode of server.
                  (Normal, Competition, or Round Robin)
fullteams       - if "on", the mod will wait for all the teams to fill up
                  before starting the match, as opposed to starting the match
                  when every person has "readied" regarldless of if the teams
                  are uneven
centerprint     - if "on", you will get a countdown printed to the center of
                  the screen and "FIGHT!" when the match has begun.


playerlist
~~~~~~~~~~

The playerlist command shows which team each player belongs to. If the team
field is blank for a player, it means that player is not on a team.
Thre are 4 fields, labeled "F D H S".  They mean, "fired", "direct hits",
"hits", "self-inflicted", respectively, and are a total accout of all the
rockets the player has fired.  These numbers are reset at the beginning of
each series.

yes
~~~

This command is used to vote yes for an election to admin.

no
~~

This command is used to vote no for an election to admin.

listmaps
~~~~~~~~

Lists the maps in the map loop.  The map loop is coded into the progs with
the "vars.qc" file.

elect
~~~~~

Used by a normal player to become admin.  During the voting time, a person
votes with "yes" and "no". The voting is controlled with the variables
"votepct" and "votetime".  "votepct" controls the percentage of votes that
must be "yes" in order for the person to become an admin.  For example, if
there are 6 people on the server, and votecpt is "50", there would need to
be at least 3 "yes" votes in order for the person to be admin'd.
The variable "votetime" is the number of seconds the voting lasts.
Default is 60.  If "votepct" is not set or is 0, voting is disabled.

These variables are coded into the progs with the "vars.qc" file.

ready
~~~~~

Adds you to the team you have specified, or enables the team you have
specified.  To specify your team, use the "team" console command.
If you join a team that's already been created, your colors will be changed
to match the team colors.

This command is disabled on servers using the menus.

admin
~~~~~

Use this command to become an admin if you enter the correct admin code. The
admin code is four digits, and you enter one digit at a time.

commands
~~~~~~~~

List available commands, and the impulse for the command.

notready
~~~~~~~~

Removes you from the team you have specified, and if you were the only player
on your team, "notready" clears the old team.

scores
~~~~~~

Only works in either Competition or Round Robin modes.  It shows the teams
participating in the current series and how many wins/losses/forfeits they
have.

cprint
~~~~~~

Toggles the centerprinted countdown on or off.

sbup, sbdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use these to increase/decrease the resolution of the status bar seen in
trackcam mode.  DO NOT increase the size of the status bar beyond the
resolution of your screen.  At its lowest setting, the status bar is turned
off.

setup
~~~~~

Gives a series of menus to help setup a match quickly.  Explained fully
in the section called "the setup command"


**************
Admin Commands
**************

pickup
~~~~~~

Clears the teams and colors for everyone on a server.  Can only be used
in Competition or Round-Robin modes when a series is not being played.
It clears any teams already created so you will need to set your team
and type "ready" again.
Useful to help set up a pickup game.

modeset
~~~~~~~

This command swicthes the mode of the clan arena mod.
If the server is running in "pickup" mode, this command is disabled.

warp
~~~~

This command is used to change maps. Enter one number at a time.
If you want to choose an id map, enter the episode number for the
first digit, the second digit is the level number.  Deathmatch maps
are chosen with 5, episode 1 with 6, episode 2 with 7, and so on.
For example, to choose dm6, enter:
warp
5
6

To choose e1m2, enter:
warp
6
2

start map is chosen with "58", end with "99"

reset
~~~~~

Use this command to reset the mod.

force
~~~~~

This command is used to start a series even though all players have not
readied up.  If "fullteams" is on and the teams are uneven, you cant use
"force" to start anyway.

kick
~~~~

When you enter this command, a list of players and their associated player
numbers will be displayed. To remove a player from the server, enter the
number of the player you wish to kick. Remember to enter one digit at a time.

lock
~~~~

This command toggles whether or not the server is locked. When the server is
locked, no players are allowed to join the server.  See: autolock.  If the
server is locked manually with this command, autolock will be disabled.
The server automatically unlocks if there are no more players on the server,
or the level is changed.
If the server is running in "pickup" mode, this command is disabled.

fullteams
~~~~~~~~~

Toggles the "fullteams" setting on or off.  With fullteams on, the mod
waits for all teams to fill up before starting a match, with it off, the
match starts as soon as everyone on the server has readied.
For example, if you were trying to set up a 4on4 on dm3.  If 5 people
join the server, 4 of whom create team A, the last creating team B, the
match starts with 4 people on team A against one person on team B.  To
get around this problem, enable fullteams, and set "teams" to 2 and "players"
to 4.  This way the server will not start the match until there are 4
people apiece on 2 different teams.

sg, ssg, ng, sng, gl, rl, lg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use these to toggle on/off a specific weapon

tmset
~~~~~

Use this to cycle between the different teamplay settings.

tmup, tmdown

Use these to increase/decrease the number of the "teams" setting.

atset
~~~~~

Use this to cylce between the different "atype" (armor type) settings.

amup, amdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use these to increase/decrease the armor setting.

hup, hdown
~~~~~~~~~~

Use these to increase/decrease the health setting.

plup, pldown
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use these to increase/decrease the number of the "players" setting.

rdup, rddown
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use these to increase/decrease the number of the "rounds" setting.

shells, nails, rockets, cells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use these to cycle between the different values for each type of ammo.
The values are 0, 30, 100, 700(infinite).
